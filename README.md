# Project Boost

A precision flying game where you pilot a small rocket through hazardous environments. Land at the finish pad to complete the level—crash and you restart. Built while following GameDev.tv’s **Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D** tutorial (https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/).

## 🎮 Gameplay
- **Player Experience:** Precision, skillful control
- **Core Mechanic:** Fly the spaceship and avoid environmental hazards
- **Game Loop:** Get from **A → B** to finish a level, then progress to the next

## ✨ Features
- Physics-based thrust and rotation
- Checkpoints/finish pads and crash/restart flow
- Hazards and safe/goal zones
- Level progression (Level 1 → Level 2 → …)
- Audio, particles, and lights triggered by state (idle, thrust, crash, success)

## 🕹️ Controls
- **Thrust:** Space / W
- **Rotate Left / Right:** A / D (or ← / →)
- **Restart Level:** R (optional, if enabled)
- **Next Level:** N (debug/optional)

## 📚 What I’m Practicing
- Classes & namespaces
- Input actions and switch statements
- Triggering audio & particle systems
- Adding and toggling lights
- Applying forces with Rigidbody (physics)

## 🚀 Getting Started
